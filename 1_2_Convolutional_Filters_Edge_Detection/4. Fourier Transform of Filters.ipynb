    "## High and Low Pass Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might be wondering, what makes filters high and low-pass; why is a Sobel filter high-pass and a Gaussian filter low-pass?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you can actually visualize the frequencies that these filters block out by taking a look at their fourier transforms. The frequency components of any image can be displayed after doing a Fourier Transform (FT). An FT looks at the components of an image (edges that are high-frequency, and areas of smooth color as low-frequency), and plots the frequencies that occur as points in spectrum. So, let's treat our filters as small images, and display them in the frequency domain!"
